# creepy-pasta-gallery
# A small and minimalist image blog for license-free images for creepyPasta web content. The content for this can be found on Pixabay, which you can find via opening the HTML file in notepad.

# This is my own spin off a small project I had to complete for a Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course.

# Note: For some reason, there are some issues with oppening the file in internet explorer. I suggest to see the CSS at work, open the HTML file using the Google Chrome web browser.
